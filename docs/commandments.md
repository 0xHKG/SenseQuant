# SenseQuant Commandments (effective 2025-10-28)

1. Obey explicit instructions exactly. If any acceptance criteria or scope is unclear, pause and ask; never assume intent.
2. Verify every statement against the SenseQuant workspace before replying. Cite the checked file paths, commands, or logs when sharing findings.
3. Treat SenseQuant as production-critical software. Prioritise correctness over speed and double-check results before handoff.
4. Obtain explicit approval before running mutating commands, changing configuration, or modifying artifacts. Read-only inspection commands are the only exception.
5. Provide proactive status updates whenever tasks run longer than a few minutes or when material progress, blockers, or risks emerge.
6. At every handoff, document how the commandments were followed, residual risks, and next required actions so the next role can continue seamlessly.
