# US-028 Phase 7 Batch 4 Ingestion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Task:** NIFTY 100 Batch 4 Symbol Discovery and Historical Data Ingestion
**Status:** Completed with 1 Known Failure

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed Batch 4 ingestion for NIFTY 100 constituents, bringing total coverage to 97.2% for this batch (35/36 symbols). One symbol (OBEROI) failed due to missing symbol mapping in the Breeze API.

## Batch Details

- **Batch ID:** Batch 4 (Final batch)
- **Symbols Targeted:** 36 symbols
- **Date Range:** 2022-01-01 to 2024-12-31 (3 years)
- **Intervals:** 1day
- **Source File:** `data/historical/metadata/nifty100_batch4.txt`

## Task 1: Symbol Discovery

**Script:** `scripts/discover_symbol_mappings.py`
**Execution Time:** ~1 minute
**Result:** 35/36 successful

### Symbol Mapping Results

- **Total symbols:** 36
- **Successfully mapped:** 35 symbols
- **Failed mappings:** 1 symbol (OBEROI)
- **New mappings discovered:** 30 (all already existed in master from Batch 3)
- **Output:** `data/historical/metadata/symbol_mappings_batch4.json`

### Failed Symbol

**OBEROI:** Breeze API returned "Result Not Found" - symbol does not exist in ISEC database or has different ticker.

## Task 2: Merge Symbol Mappings

**Action:** Merged Batch 4 mappings into master symbol mappings file
**Result:** All 30 discovered mappings already existed in `data/historical/metadata/symbol_mappings.json` from previous Batch 3 work
**Total mappings in master:** 95 mappings

## Task 3: Pre-Ingestion Audit

**Status:** Skipped (mappings already existed, no new additions)

## Task 4: Bulk Historical Data Ingestion

**Script:** `scripts/fetch_historical_data.py`
**Execution Time:** 15 minutes 9 seconds (03:08:45 - 03:23:55)
**Mode:** LIVE (temporarily enabled, restored to dryrun after completion)

### Ingestion Metrics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total symbols processed | 36 |
| Successfully fetched | 35 |
| Failed symbols | 1 (OBEROI) |
| Chunks fetched from API | 140 |
| Chunks loaded from cache | 315 |
| Failed chunks | 13 (all OBEROI) |
| Total rows ingested | 8,470 |

### Ingestion Performance

- **Cache hit rate:** 69.2% (315/455 chunks)
- **API rate limiting:** 2.0s delay between chunks
- **Average time per symbol:** 25.26 seconds
- **Data format:** Daily OHLCV bars

### Failed Ingestion

**OBEROI:** All 13 chunks failed (full date range 2022-2024). Root cause: No symbol mapping found in Task 1, Breeze API returned no data for all chunk requests.

### Log Files

- **Ingestion log:** `logs/batch4_ingestion_20251028_030837.log`
- **Summary:** Exit code 0 (completed with 1 known failure)

## Task 5: Post-Ingestion Coverage Audit

**Script:** `scripts/check_symbol_coverage.py`
**Execution Time:** <1 second
**Result:** 97.2% coverage (35/36 symbols verified)

### Coverage Summary

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| OK (data available) | 35 | 97.2% |
| Missing local | 1 | 2.8% |
| Total | 36 | 100% |

### Coverage Details

**Symbols OK (35):**
COLPAL, PIDILITIND, HAL, HINDALCO, VEDL, TATASTEEL, JINDALSTEL, NMDC, ULTRACEMCO, AMBUJACEM, ACC, SHREECEM, TRENT, ADANIENT, INDIGO, VOLTAS, MUTHOOTFIN, PFC, RECLTD, LICHSGFIN, SBILIFE, APOLLOHOSP, MAXHEALTH, FORTIS, DLF, GODREJPROP, BERGEPAINT, HAVELLS, SIEMENS, ABB, BOSCHLTD, CUMMINSIND, BHARATFORG, LTTS, LTIM

**Symbols Missing (1):**
OBEROI (missing_local - no symbol mapping available)

### Report Files

- **Detail report:** `data/historical/metadata/coverage_report_20251028_034050.jsonl`
- **Summary:** `data/historical/metadata/coverage_summary_20251028_034050.json`
- **Audit log:** `logs/batch4_coverage_audit_post.log`

## Known Issues

### OBEROI Symbol Failure

**Root Cause:** Symbol "OBEROI" does not have a valid ISEC/Breeze stock code mapping. The Breeze API `get_names()` method returned "Result Not Found" when querying this symbol.

**Impact:** Unable to fetch historical data for OBEROI. This symbol is excluded from Batch 4 coverage.

**Recommendation:**
1. Verify if OBEROI is the correct NSE ticker for this company
2. Manually check ISEC direct platform for the correct stock code
3. Consider alternative data source for this symbol
4. Update `nifty100_batch4.txt` if ticker is incorrect

## Data Quality

### Gap Detection

All 35 successfully ingested symbols showed normal weekend/holiday gaps in daily data. Example from LTIM: 146 gaps detected, all corresponding to weekends, public holidays, and market closures. No data quality issues identified.

### Duplicate Handling

The ingestion script successfully detected and removed duplicate rows where data already existed from previous runs. All chunks were deduplicated before saving.

## Files Generated

### Symbol Mappings
- `data/historical/metadata/symbol_mappings_batch4.json` (30 mappings)

### Coverage Reports
- `data/historical/metadata/coverage_report_20251028_034050.jsonl` (detailed per-symbol audit)
- `data/historical/metadata/coverage_summary_20251028_034050.json` (summary statistics)

### Logs
- `logs/batch4_ingestion_20251028_030837.log` (ingestion log with full debug output)
- `logs/batch4_coverage_audit_post.log` (coverage audit log)

### OHLCV Data
- `data/historical/{SYMBOL}/1day/*.csv` (8,470 total rows across 35 symbols)

## Summary

Batch 4 ingestion successfully completed with 97.2% coverage. 35 out of 36 symbols now have complete 3-year historical data (2022-2024) for daily intervals. OBEROI failed due to missing symbol mapping and requires manual investigation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate OBEROI ticker and ISEC stock code
2. Proceed with Batch 5 planning (if applicable)
3. Begin model training using newly ingested Batch 4 data
