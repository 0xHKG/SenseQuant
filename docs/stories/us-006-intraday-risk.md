# US-006 â€” Intraday Risk Integration & Engine Loop

**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 5 story points
**Dependencies:** US-005 (Risk & Sizing v1)

---

## Overview

Integrate RiskManager into the intraday trading flow to provide position sizing, per-symbol caps, circuit breaker protection, and accurate fee tracking for intraday positions. This completes the risk management implementation started in US-005 by extending it to intraday strategies.

---

## Problem Statement

Current intraday implementation uses hardcoded position sizing (1 share) without:
- Dynamic position sizing based on risk parameters and signal strength
- Per-symbol exposure limits for intraday positions
- Circuit breaker protection that applies to intraday trades
- Trading fees and slippage in intraday PnL calculations
- Forced square-off when circuit breaker triggers
- Risk context in journal entries (sizing rationale, fees, breaker flags)

This creates inconsistency with swing strategy risk management and limits the effectiveness of intraday trading.

---

## User Stories

### As a trader
- I want intraday positions sized using the same risk framework as swing positions
- I want per-symbol caps to apply to intraday positions
- I want circuit breaker to halt both intraday and swing trading when triggered
- I want accurate intraday PnL that includes all trading costs
- I want forced square-off of intraday positions when circuit breaker activates

### As a system operator
- I want consistent risk management across all strategies
- I want journal entries that capture risk metadata for intraday trades
- I want clear logging of intraday position sizing decisions
- I want visibility into when intraday positions are blocked by risk limits

### AC-2: Intraday Entry with Risk Management
- [ ] Engine calls `calculate_position_size()` before intraday entry
- [ ] Position size respects signal strength (scale down for lower confidence)

### AC-4: Intraday Circuit Breaker Integration
- [ ] Check circuit breaker status before opening any intraday position

## Technical Design

### Intraday Position Domain Type Extension

```python

@dataclass
class IntradayPosition:
    """Intraday position with fee tracking."""
    symbol: str
    direction: Literal["LONG", "SHORT"]

```

### Engine Intraday Entry Flow

```python
# src/services/engine.py

def tick_intraday(self, symbol: str, bar: dict) -> None:

        )

        if not risk_check.allowed:
            logger.warning(
                f"Intraday position blocked: {risk_check.reason}",

                "sentiment_score": sig.sentiment_score if hasattr(sig, "sentiment_score") else None,
            }),
        )
```

### Engine Intraday Exit Flow

```python
# src/services/engine.py

def _close_intraday_position(
    self, symbol: str, exit_price: float, reason: str
) -> None:
    """Close intraday position with fee tracking and risk recording."""
    position = self._intraday_positions[symbol]

    # Calculate exit fees
    exit_fees = self._risk_manager.calculate_fees(position.qty, exit_price)

    # Calculate gross PnL
    direction_multiplier = 1.0 if position.direction == "LONG" else -1.0
    gross_pnl = (exit_price - position.entry_price) * position.qty * direction_multiplier

    # Calculate realized PnL (net of fees)
    realized_pnl = gross_pnl - position.entry_fees - exit_fees

    # Journal with fees
    side = "SELL" if position.direction == "LONG" else "BUY"
    self.journal.log(
        symbol=symbol,
        action=side,
        qty=position.qty,
        price=exit_price,
        pnl=realized_pnl,

            "gross_pnl": gross_pnl,
            "realized_pnl": realized_pnl,
        }),
    )

    # Update risk manager and check circuit breaker
    self._risk_manager.update_position(
        symbol=symbol,
        qty=position.qty,
        price=exit_price,
        is_opening=False,
    )

    total_fees = position.entry_fees + exit_fees
    self._risk_manager.record_trade(
        symbol=symbol,

        fees=total_fees,
    )

    # Remove position
    del self._intraday_positions[symbol]

    # Check circuit breaker
    if self._risk_manager.is_circuit_breaker_active():
        logger.error(
            "CIRCUIT BREAKER ACTIVATED from intraday trade! Squaring off all positions",
            extra={"component": "engine"},
        )
        self._square_off_all_positions()
```

### Circuit Breaker Unified Square-Off

```python
# src/services/engine.py

def _square_off_all_positions(self) -> None:
    """Square off all open positions (intraday + swing) on circuit breaker."""
    # Square off intraday positions
    intraday_symbols = list(self._intraday_positions.keys())
    for symbol in intraday_symbols:
        position = self._intraday_positions[symbol]
        exit_price = position.entry_price  # Simplified for circuit breaker
        exit_fees = self._risk_manager.calculate_fees(position.qty, exit_price)

        direction_multiplier = 1.0 if position.direction == "LONG" else -1.0
        gross_pnl = (exit_price - position.entry_price) * position.qty * direction_multiplier
        realized_pnl = gross_pnl - position.entry_fees - exit_fees

        side = "SELL" if position.direction == "LONG" else "BUY"
        self.journal.log(
            symbol=symbol,
            action=side,
            qty=position.qty,
            price=exit_price,
            pnl=realized_pnl,
            reason="circuit_breaker_forced_exit",
            mode=settings.mode,
            order_id="CIRCUIT_BREAKER",
            status="FORCED_EXIT",
            strategy="intraday",
            meta_json=str({
                "entry_fees": position.entry_fees,
                "exit_fees": exit_fees,
                "realized_pnl": realized_pnl,
                "circuit_breaker": True,
            }),
        )

        self._risk_manager.update_position(
            symbol=symbol,
            qty=position.qty,
            price=exit_price,
            is_opening=False,
        )
        del self._intraday_positions[symbol]

    # Square off swing positions (existing implementation)
    self._square_off_all_swing_positions()
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (tests/unit/test_intraday.py)

- Test intraday signal generation with sentiment scores
- Test position sizing calculations
- Test fee calculations
- Maintain existing coverage for intraday strategy logic

### Integration Tests (tests/integration/test_intraday_engine.py)

- Test full intraday entry flow with risk checks
- Test position blocked by circuit breaker
- Test position blocked by per-symbol cap
- Test exit flow with fee tracking
- Test auto square-off with fees
- Test circuit breaker activation from intraday trade

### Risk Integration Tests (tests/integration/test_engine_risk.py)

- Test combined intraday + swing position tracking
- Test per-symbol cap applies to combined positions
- Test circuit breaker triggers unified square-off
- Test daily PnL includes both strategy types

---

## Migration Path

1. Extend `IntradayPosition` dataclass with fee fields
2. Update intraday entry flow in `Engine.tick_intraday()`
3. Extract position close logic into `_close_intraday_position()`
4. Update auto square-off to use `_close_intraday_position()`
5. Create unified `_square_off_all_positions()` method
6. Update journal entries with risk metadata
7. Add/update unit tests for intraday strategy
8. Add/update integration tests for intraday engine
9. Extend risk integration tests for combined scenarios
10. Run all quality gates

---

## Open Questions

1. Should intraday and swing positions share the same per-symbol cap or have separate caps?
   - **Decision:** Shared cap - prevents total exposure on a symbol from exceeding limits

2. Should circuit breaker thresholds be different for intraday vs swing?
   - **Decision:** No, single threshold applies to combined daily PnL

3. How to handle partial position closes for intraday?
   - **Decision:** Out of scope for v1, assume full position closes only

---

## Success Metrics

- All 94 existing tests continue to pass
- New integration tests pass for intraday risk scenarios
- Circuit breaker correctly halts both intraday and swing trading
- Journal entries include complete risk metadata
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
